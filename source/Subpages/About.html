      Branchey's is a small programming company founded in july of 2021 by
      Branislav Juhás to publish newly developed Gasbag, Android version. There
      are several programs in development that might result in company's growth.
      Purpose of our company is to show young students how easy is programming
      when they choose correct c-based language. our next idea is to make
      popular MS DOS programming in x86 Assembly language because it is really
      usefull in many industries. This site is like our products our intelectual
      property and it is forbiden to copy any part of it. <br />
